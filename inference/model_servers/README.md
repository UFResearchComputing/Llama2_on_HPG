## [Running Llama2 On-Prem with vLLM and TGI](llama-on-prem.md)
This tutorial shows how to use Llama 2 with [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) and Hugging Face [TGI](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference) to build Llama 2 on-prem apps.

\* To run a quantized Llama2 model on iOS and Android, you can use  the open source [MLC LLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm) or [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp). You can even make a Linux OS that boots to Llama2 ([repo](https://github.com/trholding/llama2.c)).
